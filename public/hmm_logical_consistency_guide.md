# HMM Logical Consistency Improvements

## Problem Identified

The original HMM implementation had logical inconsistencies in its predictions:

**Example Issue:**
- **High Risk** → **Emergency** (logical)
- **Extreme Risk** → **Warning** (illogical - should be Emergency)

## Root Cause

The original model used random probability generation for emission matrices, which didn't capture the natural relationships between observations and states.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Logical Emission Matrix Generation**

Instead of random probabilities, the model now uses predefined logical mappings:

```typescript
const logicalMappings = {
  'Normal': ['Low Risk', 'Stable'],
  'Alert': ['Low Risk', 'Medium Risk'],
  'Warning': ['Medium Risk', 'High Risk'],
  'Emergency': ['High Risk', 'Extreme Risk'],
  'Critical': ['Extreme Risk', 'Critical'],
  'Recovery': ['Improving', 'Stable']
};
```

### 2. **Probability Assignment Strategy**

- **High Probability (0.8)**: For logical matches (e.g., Extreme Risk → Emergency)
- **Medium Probability (0.3)**: For near matches (e.g., High Risk → Warning)
- **Low Probability (0.1)**: For all other combinations

### 3. **Viterbi-like Prediction Algorithm**

The model now uses a more sophisticated prediction algorithm that:

1. **Considers emission probabilities** for each observation-state pair
2. **Applies transition logic** to maintain realistic state sequences
3. **Balances emission likelihood** with transition probabilities

### 4. **Visual Consistency Indicators**

The interface now shows:
- ✅ **Green badges** for logical matches
- ⚠️ **Orange badges** for near matches
- **Observation → State** mapping for each prediction

## Expected Results

With these improvements, the model should now produce logically consistent predictions:

**Example Sequence: Low, Medium, High, Extreme, High**

**Before (Random):**
1. Low Risk → Normal ✓
2. Medium Risk → Warning ✓
3. High Risk → Emergency ✓
4. Extreme Risk → Warning ❌ (illogical)
5. High Risk → Warning ✓

**After (Logical):**
1. Low Risk → Normal ✓
2. Medium Risk → Warning ✓
3. High Risk → Emergency ✓
4. Extreme Risk → Emergency ✓ (logical!)
5. High Risk → Emergency ✓

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions Added:

1. **`generateLogicalEmissionMatrix()`**: Creates emission probabilities based on logical mappings
2. **`isLogicalMatch()`**: Determines if a state-observation pair is logically consistent
3. **`isNearMatch()`**: Identifies reasonable but not perfect matches
4. **`predictStatesWithLogic()`**: Implements Viterbi-like algorithm for state prediction

### Benefits:

- **Logical Consistency**: Predictions now make intuitive sense
- **Educational Value**: Students can see how HMMs should work in practice
- **Real-world Applicability**: Model behavior matches real disaster management scenarios
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show prediction quality

## Usage Notes

1. **Select appropriate states and observations** for your disaster scenario
2. **Enter realistic observation sequences** (e.g., escalating risk levels)
3. **Look for green checkmarks** indicating logical predictions
4. **Orange warnings** indicate near-matches that might need review

This implementation demonstrates how proper HMM training and parameter selection can lead to more meaningful and interpretable results in real-world applications.
